                Socrates (Greek: Σωκράτης; c. 470–399 BC) was a Greek
                philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of
                Western philosophy and among the first moral philosophers of the
                ethical tradition of thought. An enigmatic figure, Socrates
                authored no texts and is known mainly through the posthumous
                accounts of classical writers, particularly his students Plato
                and Xenophon. These accounts are written as dialogues, in which
                Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of
                question and answer; they gave rise to the Socratic dialogue
                literary genre. Contradictory accounts of Socrates make a
                reconstruction of his philosophy nearly impossible, a situation
                known as the Socratic problem. Socrates was a polarizing figure
                in Athenian society. In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and
                corrupting the youth. After a trial that lasted a day, he was
                sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing
                offers to help him escape.

                Plato (Greek: Πλάτων Plátōn; 428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC)
                was an ancient Greek philosopher born in Athens during the
                Classical period in Ancient Greece. In Athens, Plato founded the
                Academy, a philosophical school where he taught the
                philosophical doctrines that would later became known as
                Platonism. Plato (or Platon) was a pen name derived from his
                nickname - allegedly a reference to his broad shoulders -
                According to Alexander of Miletus quoted by Diogenes of Sinope
                his actual name was Aristocles, son of Ariston, of the deme
                Collytus (Collytus being a district of Athens).

                Epicurus (Greek: Ἐπίκουρος Epikouros; 341–270 BC) was an ancient
                Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly
                influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek
                island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus,
                Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against
                the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known
                as "the Garden", in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were
                known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of
                philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to
                join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works
                said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects,
                the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters
                written by him—the letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and
                Herodotus—and two collections of quotes—the Principal Doctrines
                and the Vatican Sayings—have survived intact, along with a few
                fragments of his other writings.

                Zeno of Citium (Greek: Ζήνων ὁ Κιτιεύς, Zēnōn ho Kitieus; c. 334
                – c. 262 BC) was a Hellenistic philosopher from Citium (Κίτιον,
                Kition), Cyprus. Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of
                philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based
                on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis
                on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of
                virtue in accordance with nature. It proved very popular, and
                flourished as one of the major schools of philosophy from the
                Hellenistic period through to the Roman era, and enjoyed
                revivals in the Renaissance as Neostoicism and in the current
                era as Modern Stoicism.

                Plotinus (Greek: Πλωτῖνος, Plōtînos; c. 204/5 – 270 CE) was a
                philosopher in the Hellenistic tradition, born and raised in
                Roman Egypt. Plotinus is regarded by modern scholarship as the
                founder of Neoplatonism. His teacher was the self-taught
                philosopher Ammonius Saccas, who belonged to the Platonic
                tradition. Historians of the 19th century invented the term
                "neoplatonism" and applied it to refer to Plotinus and his
                philosophy, which was vastly influential during Late Antiquity,
                the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Much of the biographical
                information about Plotinus comes from Porphyry's preface to his
                edition of Plotinus' most notable literary work, The Enneads. In
                his metaphysical writings, Plotinus described three fundamental
                principles: the One, the Intellect, and the Soul. His works have
                inspired centuries of Pagan, Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, and
                Islamic metaphysicians and mystics, including developing
                precepts that influence mainstream theological concepts within
                religions, such as his work on duality of the One in two
                metaphysical states.
